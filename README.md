# Data-Engineering-Projects

# This page documents various data engineering projects.  I have done many at work cannot be shared publicly due to various regulatory restrictions. However, many techniques and concepts are transferrable. I have identified a number of such practical projects that I can apply these skills. I would want to share here at github.  
# Postgre SQL, SQL Server, Jupyter 

# Project 1 - SQL - Datacamp's Analyzing NYC Public School Test Records 

> Concepts covered: initial inspecting data, finding missing data, filtering, ranking window function, 

## Every year, school test results play a role in deciding the fate of millions of students. In America, the SAT is a major part of the college admissions process. In this project, you will work with a SQL database containing test performance from NYC's public schools. You will look at how performance varies by borough, identify how many schools fail to report information, and find the top ten performing schools across the city!

# Project 2 - SQL - Datacamp's Analyzing American Baby Name Trends 

> Concepts covered: various categorization and ranking techniques, common expression tables, complex subqueries. 

## What makes a name timeless or trendy? In this project, you'll use data published by the U.S. Social Security Administration spanning over a hundred years to understand American baby name tastes. The ranking, grouping, joining, ordering, and pattern matching skills you'll use in this project are broadly applicable: understanding changing tastes is a key competency for businesses as well as parents searching for a baby name!

# Project 3 - SQL - The oldest's business in the world 

> Concepts covered: join, filter within aggregated groups. 

# Project 4 - Python, Pandas/matplotlib libraries - Exploratory Data Analysis- Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office 

## What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into the largest entertainment/media company by market capitalization, boasting over 200 million subscribers as of January 2021. Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex our data manipulation skills and dive into the entertainment industry.

## preliminary findings: non-typical genres such as children's movies and documentaries are all clustered around the bottom half of the plot. But we can't know for certain until we perform additional analyses.

> Concepts covered: data manipulation, zip() method, dictionary data structures, DataFrame, visualization, scatter plot, subsetting, iterrows().

# Project 5 - SQL - Analyze International Debt Stats 

## This project analyzes international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. Interesting questions to answer: a. What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset? b. Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like? c. What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?

> Concepts/Techniques covered: data manipulation within SQL,  Importing/Cleaning data, Join/CWE.
